# Fix Vercel Deployment Protection Issue

## Problem
You're getting a Vercel authentication page instead of your API responses because **Deployment Protection** is enabled on your Vercel project.

## Solution 1: Disable Deployment Protection (Recommended)

### Steps:
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `room-c21wsflx6-vivek-kumars-projects-888c40b7`
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Scroll down to **"Deployment Protection"**
5. Change from **"Password Protection"** to **"No Protection"**
6. Click **Save**

### Why this works:
- APIs should be publicly accessible
- Deployment protection is meant for preview deployments, not production APIs
- Your API endpoints need to be accessible without authentication

## Solution 2: Use Bypass Token (Alternative)

If you want to keep protection but allow API access:

### Steps:
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to **Settings** → **General**
2. Under **"Deployment Protection"**, copy the **Bypass Token**
3. Add the token to your API calls:

```bash
# Example with bypass token
curl --location 'https://room-c21wsflx6-vivek-kumars-projects-888c40b7.vercel.app/payments/route/linked-accounts/acc_RFCPRGX6BTtVem?x-vercel-protection-bypass=YOUR_BYPASS_TOKEN' \
--header 'Accept: application/json'
```

## Solution 3: Environment-Specific Protection

You can also set different protection levels for different environments:
- **Production**: No Protection (for public API access)
- **Preview**: Password Protection (for testing)

## Testing Your Fix

After disabling deployment protection, test these endpoints:

### 1. Root endpoint:
```bash
curl https://room-c21wsflx6-vivek-kumars-projects-888c40b7.vercel.app/
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "message": "RoomPe Payment Server is running!",
  "status": "active",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "endpoints": {
    "health": "/health",
    "payments": "/payments/*"
  }
}
```

### 2. Health check:
```bash
curl https://room-c21wsflx6-vivek-kumars-projects-888c40b7.vercel.app/health
```

### 3. Your API endpoint:
```bash
curl https://room-c21wsflx6-vivek-kumars-projects-888c40b7.vercel.app/payments/route/linked-accounts/acc_RFCPRGX6BTtVem
```

## Client Configuration

Your client is now configured to use the correct URL:
- **Development**: `http://192.168.1.88:4000`
- **Production**: `https://room-c21wsflx6-vivek-kumars-projects-888c40b7.vercel.app`

## Common Issues

1. **Still getting auth page**: Make sure you disabled protection for the correct environment (Production)
2. **CORS errors**: Your server already has CORS enabled, so this should work
3. **404 errors**: Make sure your routes are properly configured (they are)

## Next Steps

1. Disable deployment protection in Vercel dashboard
2. Test your API endpoints
3. Update your mobile app to use the production URL
4. Test the full payment flow
