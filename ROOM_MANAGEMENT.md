  unitType: UnitType;
  sharingType?: RoomSharingType;
  capacity: number;
  isOccupied: boolean;
  tenantIds: string[];

  amenities: string[];
  status: 'available' | 'occupied' | 'maintenance' | 'reserved';
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

```typescript
interface Floor {
  id: string;
  floorNumber: number;
  floorName: string;
  totalUnits: number;
  filledUnits: number;
  vacantUnits: number;
  units: Unit[];

  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state management
- Separate states for units, floors, tenants, and UI controls
- Real-time updates for occupancy and status changes

### Data Flow
1. Load property data on component mount
2. Fetch available tenants for assignment
3. Update unit status on tenant assignment/vacation
4. Refresh data on pull-to-refresh

### UI Components
- **UnitCard**: Displays individual unit information
- **FloorSection**: Groups units by floor
- **SearchBar**: Provides search functionality
- **FilterChips**: Status and type filters
- **Modal**: Add unit and assign tenant forms

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Unit Images**: Add photos for each unit
- **Amenity Management**: Detailed amenity configuration
- **Maintenance Requests**: Track maintenance issues
- **Payment Integration**: Link with payment system
- **Notifications**: Alert for unit status changes
- **Reports**: Generate occupancy and revenue reports
- **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple tenants at once

### Advanced Analytics
- **Occupancy Trends**: Historical occupancy data
- **Revenue Analytics**: Rent collection analysis
- **Tenant Turnover**: Track tenant movement patterns
- **Property Performance**: Compare with market rates

## Integration Points

### Firebase Integration
- Firestore for data storage
- Real-time updates
- User authentication
- Cloud functions for business logic

### Navigation
- Integrates with main app navigation
- Property selection flow
- Tenant management screens
- Payment and maintenance screens

## Best Practices

### Data Validation
- Validate unit numbers for uniqueness
- Ensure rent and deposit are positive numbers
- Check capacity limits
- Verify tenant assignment constraints

### User Experience
- Provide clear feedback for all actions
- Use loading states for async operations
- Implement error handling
- Maintain consistent UI patterns

### Performance
- Optimize list rendering for large datasets
- Implement pagination for large properties
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Unit not appearing**: Check if unit was added to correct floor
2. **Tenant assignment fails**: Verify tenant is available and unit is vacant
3. **Search not working**: Ensure search query matches unit number or tenant name
4. **Filters not applying**: Check if filter criteria are correctly set

### Debug Information
- Check console logs for error messages
- Verify data structure matches expected format
- Ensure all required fields are populated
- Test with different unit types and statuses
